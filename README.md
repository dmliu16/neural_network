# neural_network

This is my implementation of an artificial neural network from scratch, with one hidden layer. 
The neural network uses sigmoid as activation functions, and the users can input the training
file, developing file, key of the training file, number of neurons desired, number of epochs
desired, and the desired learning rate. Also, the user can enter an optional key for the
developing file to evaluate the accuracy of the neural network trained. 

Finally, to train the neural net on different files, users need to change some part of the files
marked with comments to fix the format of the input data.
